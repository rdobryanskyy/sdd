# Size matrix — XS/S/M/L/XL classification + MVP-vs-Full artifact set

## How to classify size

The four signals (`classify-size` asks one `AskUserQuestion` per signal):

| Signal | XS | S | M | L | XL |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **PR count** | 1 | 2–5 | 5–15 | 15+ | many, staged |
| **Time to merge main part** | ≤1 day | ~1 week | 1–2 sprints | >1 month | own roadmap |
| **New module / new API / migration** | none | ≤1 of three | 1–2 of three | 2–3 of three | new subsystem |
| **Breaking changes for consumers** | no | internal only | internal or public | public | public + cross-team |

- **XS** — 1 PR, ≤1 day, no migration, no new API. (Typo, copy fix, config tweak.)
- **S** — 2–5 PRs, ~1 week, maybe a small migration.
- **M** — separate epic, 1–2 sprints, new module / API / migration.
- **L** — cross-module, several teams, breaking changes possible.
- **XL** — new subsystem, needs a separate roadmap.

On edge cases, name the dominant signal: «this is M because it adds a new API + 1–2 sprints, even though PR count is on the S/M border».

> **One-sentence rule.** If you hesitate between MVP and Full — start with MVP. Filling the empty sections of an artifact later is cheaper than discarding pre-built ones.

## MVP-vs-Full artifact set

Artifact depth ∝ feature size. XS/S → minimal set; M+ → full.

| Artifact (skill) | MVP (XS/S) | Full (M+) |
|---|---|---|
| spec — `specify` | yes | yes |
| clarify pass — `clarify` | light (skip if no ambiguity) | yes |
| CONTEXT.md glossary — `glossary` | yes | yes |
| SAD (Arc42 12 §) + C4 L1/L2 — `design` | 12 sections walked, more `<!-- N/A -->` allowed | all 12 filled |
| ADRs (in `adr/`) — `design` / `decide-adr` | 2–4 typical | 5–12 typical |
| sequence diagrams — `sequences` | every AC covered, detail collapsed | as many flows as the user-stories/ACs need — never a cap; XS/S may collapse detail but still cover every AC |
| deployment view — `design` §7 | `<!-- N/A -->` if no infra change | yes |
| data-model + migrations — `data-model` | if DB touched | yes |
| API contract (OpenAPI) — `api` | yes | yes |
| events — `api` | if async | yes |
| task breakdown + tasks.json — `tasks` | yes | yes |
| test-plan — `plan-tests` | inline in spec | separate file |
| implementation — `implement` | yes | yes |

## SAD size behaviour

Even for XS/S, `design` walks all 12 Arc42 sections — consistency beats completeness theatre. Sections that genuinely don't apply get `<!-- N/A: <one-line reason> -->`. Common XS/S N/A patterns:

- §7 Deployment — `<!-- N/A: reuses existing deployment unit, no infra change -->`
- §6 Runtime — collapses to the **fewest flows that still cover every §5 AC** (often one flow with the error branches inline as `alt`, rather than separate failure-mode flows). Detail collapses; AC-coverage does not — `sequences` still maps every AC to a flow, a branch, or an explicit N/A even at XS/S.
- §11 Risks — one accepted-debt row, no medium/high risks.

Same skill, same template, smaller content footprint.

## Wrappers / gates

A skill that reads `.size` skips heavy sub-artifacts for XS/S (separate test-plan, deployment view, full ADR sweep). Absent `.size` → default to **M** (full set), the safe over-production default.
