# SDD — Spec-Driven Development for Claude Code

A self-contained Claude Code plugin that carries a feature from a one-line idea to
**reviewed, verified, shipped** code through **15 atomic, stack-agnostic skills** and a
**TDD implementation engine**.

Every skill is Socratic (it walks decisions with you, it doesn't dump a wall of output),
gated (a stage hard-refuses when its prerequisite artifact is missing), and stack-agnostic
(no language, tracker, or test tool is hard-coded — the skills detect what your repo uses).

## Install

```text
/plugin marketplace add genkovich/sdd
/plugin install sdd@sdd
```

## Start here

**On an existing codebase, run `survey` once first.** It scans the repo and writes
`docs/architecture-map.md` — the current architecture (module layout, conventions, datastores,
a C4 of what exists). Every later stage reads that map instead of re-discovering your codebase,
and `specify` writes the spec already aware of what's there. Refresh it when the repo drifts.

**Then run `specify`.** You don't bring a spec — `specify` *creates* it: a short interview asks
about the idea (the problem, who it's for, what "done" looks like) and writes `spec.md`. That
spec is the seed everything downstream reads.

```text
/sdd-survey                         ← once per repo: maps the current architecture
/sdd-specify checkout-discounts     ← interviews you, writes the spec
```

From there you walk the backbone in order. Each step reads the previous step's file and
refuses if it's missing, so you can't skip ahead by accident.

## The flow

There are three kinds of skill. Most of your time is the **backbone** — a straight line you
walk in order. A few are **utilities** you call whenever you need them. Two **close the loop**
after the code is written.

### Step 0 — survey (once per repo, before the backbone)

| # | Skill | What it does | Reads → Produces |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **survey** | Scans the existing codebase once and persists the current architecture, so later stages don't re-discover it. Refresh when the repo drifts. | the repo → `docs/architecture-map.md` |

### Backbone — the straight line (run in order)

| # | Skill | What it does | Reads → Produces |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **specify** | Interviews you to capture the idea, writes the product spec + acceptance criteria (reads the architecture map for constraints) | *your idea*, `architecture-map.md` → `spec.md` |
| 2 | **clarify** | Sweeps the spec for ambiguities (a devil's-advocate pass), closes or defers each | `spec.md` → tightened `spec.md` |
| 3 | **design** | **Matches the feature to your existing architecture** (see below), writes the Arc42 SAD + C4 + ADRs | `spec.md`, `CONTEXT.md` → `sad.md`, `adr/*` |
| 4 | **sequences** | Draws the runtime flows as Mermaid sequence diagrams | `sad.md` → `sad.md §6` |
| 5 | **data-model** | Designs the schema and writes the actual forward+rollback migrations | `spec.md`, `sad.md`, sequences → `data-model.md`, `*.up/down.sql` |
| 6 | **api** | Derives the OpenAPI contract from the data model + sequences + spec | `data-model.md`, sequences, `spec.md` → `contracts/openapi.yaml` |
| 7 | **tasks** | Breaks the work into atomic ≤1-day tasks + a `tasks.json` dependency DAG | all of the above → `tasks/*`, **`tasks.json`** |
| 8 | **plan-tests** | Maps every acceptance criterion to ≥1 test (inline in the spec for XS/S) | `spec.md`, `data-model.md` → `test-plan.md` |
| 9 | **implement** | The TDD engine: writes a failing test, makes it pass, gates, commits — per task | `tasks.json` + all artifacts → code + tests, committed |

### Close the loop (after the code is written)

| # | Skill | What it does | Reads → Produces |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10 | **review** | An **independent, clean-context** code review of the *whole* change against spec/AC + quality | the diff + `spec.md` → review record, `PASS` / `CHANGES REQUESTED` |
| 11 | **ship** | **Verifies the feature actually runs** (not just green tests), writes the changelog, opens the PR | the reviewed change → changelog + PR (never auto-merges) |

`review` can bounce back to `implement` if it finds an unmet acceptance criterion. `ship` is the
end: a reviewed, verified change with a changelog and an open PR — merging to main stays your call.

> **"We test and review, right?"** Yes — in two places. `implement` runs a **per-task gate**
> (unit + integration + lint + vet) on every task as it goes, so each task is green before it's
> committed. Then `review` does the **independent, whole-change** code review a human reviewer
> would do on the PR, and `ship` **runs the feature for real** against its acceptance criteria.
> Tests-pass happens continuously inside `implement`; the cross-cutting review + real-world
> verification are the explicit `review` and `ship` steps.

### Utilities — call whenever you need them (not part of the line)

- **classify-size** — size the feature XS/S/M/L/XL (writes `.size`); later skills read it to decide MVP vs full depth. Run it at the start, or any time scope changes.
- **glossary** — capture a domain term in `CONTEXT.md` with a definition. Run it whenever a new term shows up; `design` and the spec read the glossary.
- **decide-adr** — write a standalone ADR after the fact, when `tasks` (or a review) flags a decision that needs recording but wasn't captured during `design`.

## Where the spec comes from

It's not an input you have to write — **`specify` produces it.** Its interview front asks 3–5
questions about the problem, the users, and what success looks like, then drafts the spec,
validates each acceptance criterion with you, and runs a clean-context critic before writing
`spec.md`. The idea is the input; the spec is the output.

## Where we study the codebase / hold the current architecture

The existing system is studied **once, in `survey`** (Step 0), which persists
`docs/architecture-map.md` — the current architecture: module layout, layering, datastores,
conventions, and a C4 of what exists. That map is the single source of "what's already here":

- **`specify`** reads it so the spec's constraints / non-goals reflect the real system (without
  leaking tech into the acceptance criteria).
- **`design`** reads it and **matches** the feature to that reality — the SAD describes *your*
  system extended, not a greenfield design in a vacuum. It re-scans (via `sdd-explorer`) only if
  the map is missing or stale.
- **`data-model`** and **`implement`** read it for the persistence + wiring conventions the new
  code must follow, instead of each re-discovering them.

So you don't re-open "what's the current architecture?" at every stage — `survey` answers it once
and the map carries it. Refresh the map (`survey` again) when the repo has drifted past the
`reflects_commit` it records. In `design`, decisions expensive to reverse cross a blast-radius
gate and become ADRs.

## The implementation engine

`implement` reads `tasks.json`, builds a dependency DAG, and runs a **TDD cycle per task** —
`SELECT → RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → GATE → COMMIT`. It writes a failing test first, proves the
failure is for the right reason, writes the minimal code to pass, keeps refactors green, runs
the gate, and commits with `SDD-Task` / `SDD-AC` trailers.

Three execution modes, chosen automatically from settings + DAG shape (with graceful fallback):

- **Sequential single-agent TDD** — the default and the floor everything degrades to.
- **Agent team** (`team_mode: true`) — `sdd-test-author` → `sdd-implementer` → `sdd-reviewer`
  over the DAG, coordinated through a shared task list, one git worktree per agent.
- **Dynamic workflow** (`workflow_mode: auto`) — a generated `Workflow` pipeline that fans out
  independent tasks up to a parallelism cap.

## Models, effort & agents

Every skill and every agent declares an **execution profile** in its frontmatter — which model,
how much reasoning effort, and which agents it spawns:

```yaml
# a skill's frontmatter
model: opus        # haiku | sonnet | opus | inherit
effort: high       # low | medium | high | xhigh | max
agents: [sdd-critic]   # the agents this skill spawns
```

Model is chosen by the **kind of work**, not by taste:

| Kind of work | Model | Effort | Who |
|---|---|---|---|
| Judgment (spec, design, review, critique, ambiguity) | `opus` | `high` | specify, clarify, design, review · `sdd-reviewer` / `sdd-critic` / `sdd-devils-advocate` |
| Execution (write tests, write code) | `sonnet` | `medium` → `high` on escalation | `sdd-test-author`, `sdd-implementer` |
| Search / scan / derivation | `haiku` / `inherit` | `low` / `medium` | `sdd-explorer`; data-model, api, sequences, tasks |

The six agents (`agents/`): **sdd-explorer** (brownfield scan, read-only), **sdd-test-author**
(writes failing tests), **sdd-implementer** (makes them pass), **sdd-reviewer** (independent
review, read-only), **sdd-critic** (coherence critique, read-only), **sdd-devils-advocate**
(ambiguity hunt, read-only). The four read-only agents run in **clean isolated context** — fresh
eyes are the point — and emit only cited findings. Full policy + the agent contract:
[`skills/_shared/agent-roster.md`](./skills/_shared/agent-roster.md).

Override precedence is `env var > settings > frontmatter > session`. Because the `effort:`
frontmatter has been reported as a no-op on some Claude Code builds, the implement engine also
exports `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` / `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` for its dispatches — so effort
takes effect even where the frontmatter doesn't. Effort also scales with the feature `.size`
(L/XL bumps execution effort to `high`). Set `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` yourself if a run feels
under-reasoned.

### Configuration — `.claude/sdd.local.md`

`implement` lazy-creates this per-project settings file (YAML frontmatter) on first run with
safe defaults; edit it to change behaviour:

```yaml
tdd: true                  # enforce red→green→refactor
team_mode: false           # true → agent team via TeamCreate
workflow_mode: auto        # auto → dynamic Workflow; off → never
max_parallel_agents: 3
isolation: worktree        # worktree | inplace (parallel>1 ⇒ forces worktree)
stop_on_red: true
max_red_retries: 3
gate_lint: true
gate_vet: true
require_integration: auto  # auto | always | never (Docker-probed)
auto_commit: per_task      # per_task | per_phase | off
branch_strategy: feature   # feature | current
cmd_test_unit: ""          # empty = autodetect (escape hatch)
cmd_test_integration: ""
cmd_lint: ""
cmd_vet: ""
model_test_author: sonnet  # per-role model + effort (see Models, effort & agents)
model_implementer: sonnet
model_reviewer: opus
effort_test_author: medium # raised to high on escalation / for L-XL features
effort_implementer: medium
effort_reviewer: high
```

Command detection is a stack-agnostic cascade: settings override → Makefile targets →
`package.json` scripts → language manifests (`go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, …) →
Docker probe for the integration tier.
