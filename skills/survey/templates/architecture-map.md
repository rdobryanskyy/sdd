# Architecture map — <repo name>

> The **current** architecture (what exists today), produced by `survey` and read by
> specify / design / data-model / implement. Refresh with `survey` when the repo drifts past
> `reflects_commit`. This is generated; a hand-maintained `docs/architecture.md`, if present, is
> authoritative and reconciled below — not replaced.

## Stack

<!-- instruction: primary language(s) + frameworks + versions, build/test tooling. Cited. -->

- Language / runtime: <…> (`file`)
- Frameworks: <…>
- Build / test / lint: <commands the repo uses — feeds implement's detection>

## C4 — system as it is

<!-- instruction: a C4 Context + Container of WHAT EXISTS (not a target design). Real names. -->

```mermaid
C4Container
    title Current containers — <repo>
    Person(user, "<actor>", "<role>")
    Container(mod_a, "<module>", "<tech>", "<responsibility>")
    ContainerDb(store, "<datastore>", "<engine>", "<what it holds>")
    Rel(user, mod_a, "<how>")
    Rel(mod_a, store, "<how>")
```

## Module inventory

<!-- instruction: one row per top-level module/package, with its layers + where it's wired. -->

| Module | Path | Layers | Wired at | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <name> | `<path>` | domain/app/infra/ports | `<file:line>` | <one line> |

## Conventions (cited — the rules a new feature must match)

<!-- instruction: the cross-cutting patterns, each with ONE cited example. These are what design/
implement must conform to. -->

- **Module wiring / registration:** <pattern> — e.g. `<file:line>`
- **Error handling:** <pattern> — `<file:line>`
- **IDs:** <pattern> — `<file:line>`
- **Persistence / DB access:** <pattern> — `<file:line>`
- **Migrations:** <naming + tool> — `<file>` (also see `.claude/rules/migrations.md` if present)
- **Tests:** <unit/integration style + harness> — `<file:line>`
- **Inter-module communication:** <direct call / events / HTTP> — `<file:line>`

## Datastores

| Store | Engine | Accessed via | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|

## Where things live / closest precedents

<!-- instruction: a short guide — "a feature like X lives here and looks like <precedent>". Helps
design slot the new feature in and helps implement copy the right pattern. -->

- A new <kind> feature → `<path>`, modelled on `<existing feature>` (`<file:line>`).

## Constraints & known tech-debt

<!-- instruction: things a new feature must respect or work around — version pins, a module that
forbids edits, an in-flight migration, a deprecated pattern. Feeds specify §2 / design §2 + §11. -->

- <constraint / debt> — <impact on new work>

## Reconciliation with the authored architecture doc

<!-- instruction: if docs/architecture.md (or similar) exists, note alignment + any drift found.
If none, say "no authored architecture doc; this map is the current reference." -->
